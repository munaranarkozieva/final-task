Feature: SauceDemo Login Functionality
  As a user
  I want to log in to SauceDemo
  So that I can access the inventory page or see appropriate error messages

  Background:
    Given the user is on the SauceDemo login page

  @UC-1 @EmptyCredentials
  Scenario: Login with empty credentials
    When the user clears the username and password fields using XPath
    And clicks the login button using XPath
    Then an error message "Username is required" should appear using XPath

  @UC-2 @MissingPassword
  Scenario: Login with username but no password
    When the user enters "standard_user" in the username field using XPath
    And clears the password field using XPath
    And clicks the login button using XPath
    Then an error message "Password is required" should appear using XPath

  @UC-3 @ValidCredentials
  Scenario Outline: Login with valid credentials
    When the user enters "<username>" in the username field using XPath
    And enters "secret_sauce" in the password field using XPath
    And clicks the login button using XPath
    Then the user should be redirected to the inventory page with title "Swag Labs"
